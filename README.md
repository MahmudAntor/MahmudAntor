### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antor and I'm currently doing a research based masters at [Brock University](https://brocku.ca/). My professor and I will be working on Federated Learning. In simple terms this is a distributed machine learning strategy where data does not have to leave the origin, hence data privacy is maintained.

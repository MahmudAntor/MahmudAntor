### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antor and I'm a Software Engineer at [SSD-TECH](https://ssd-tech.io/), which provides custom-made and innovative solutions for telecommunication operators, enterprises, and caters to specific needs of the people of Bangladesh.

I will be writing about different topics in here : [My Blog](https://MahmudAntor.github.io/)

I have a B.Sc. in CSE from [CUET](https://www.cuet.ac.bd/) and I graduated in 2019. My technical interests are:
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Data Science
- Security
- Problem Solving in general.

Outside of my technical life, my other interests are:

- Reading/Learning : I spend most of my free time trying to learn stuffs. I try to learn something new everyday.
- Cultural Enthusiast : I practice a little bit of singing, dancing and other forms of art. I developed my interest while I was completing my B.Sc. There I was General Secretary of this little cultural club **JOYODDHONEY**
- Writing : I sometimes try to write Poems and stories. You will find them in [My Blog](https://MahmudAntor.github.io/).
